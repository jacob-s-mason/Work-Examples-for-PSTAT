# Work-Examples-for-PSTAT
This is a set of work that will be used for my PSTAT application process.  All data is manufactured (due to the sensitive nature of my work) but there are some good technique to mimic. 

The projects are a basic exploratory data analysis and a model building from scratch. They display simple but fundemental techniques.
